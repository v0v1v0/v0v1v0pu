<h2>Tools for processing the UK Biobank NMR metabolomics biomarker data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>@description
This package provides utilities for working with the
<a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=220">UK Biobank MR metabolomics data</a>.
Details are provided below, and in the package vignette (type <code>vignette("ukbnmr")</code> to view).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are three groups of functions in this package: (1) data extraction,
(2) removal of technical variation, and (3) recomputing derived biomarkers
and biomarker ratios.
</p>
<p>All functions can be applied directly to raw data extracted from UK Biobank.
</p>
<p>This package also provides a <code>data.frame</code> of biomarker information, loaded
as <code>nmr_info</code>, and <code>data.frame</code> of sample processing information,
loaded as <code>sample_qc_info</code>.
</p>


<h3>Data Extraction Functions</h3>

<p>The <code>extract_biomarkers()</code> function will take a raw dataset output
by <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide">ukbconv</a>,
extract the <a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=220">NMR biomarker fields</a>
and give them short comprehensible column names as described in <code>nmr_info</code>. Measurements are also split
into multiple rows where a participant has measurements at both baseline and first repeat assessment.
</p>
<p>The <code>extract_biomarker_qc_flags()</code> function will take a raw dataset output
by <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide">ukbconv</a>,
extract the <a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=221">Nightingale quality control flags</a>
for each biomarker measurement, returning a single column per biomarker
(corresponding to respective columns output by <code>extract_biomarkers()</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>extract_sample_qc_flags()</code>function will take a raw dataset output
by <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide">ukbconv</a>,
and extract the <a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=222">sample quality control tags</a>
for the Nightingale NMR metabolomics data.
</p>


<h3>Removal of technical variation</h3>

<p>The <code>remove_technical_variation()</code> function will take a raw dataset output by
<a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide)">ukbconv</a>,
remove the effects of technical variation on biomarker concentrations, and return a list
containing the adjusted NMR biomarker data, biomarker QC flags, and sample quality control
and processing information.
</p>
<p>This applies a multistep process as described in Ritchie <em>et al.</em> 2023:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>First biomarker data is filtered to the 107 biomarkers that
cannot be derived from any combination of other biomarkers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolute concentrations are log transformed, with a small offset
applied to biomarkers with concentrations of 0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for the time between sample preparation
and sample measurement (hours) on a log scale.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for systematic differences between rows
(A-H) on the 96-well shipment plates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for remaining systematic differences
between columns (1-12) on the 96-well shipment plates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for drift over time within each of the six
spectrometers. To do so, samples are grouped into 10 bins, within each
spectrometer, by the date the majority of samples on their respective
96-well plates were measured.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regression residuals after the sequential adjustments are
transformed back to absolute concentrations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samples belonging to shipment plates that are outliers of
non-biological origin are identified and set to missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 61 composite biomarkers and 81 biomarker ratios are recomputed
from their adjusted parts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional 76 biomarker ratios of potential biological
significance are computed.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Further details can be found in Ritchie S. C. <em>et al.</em> Quality control
and removal of technical variation of NMR metabolic biomarker data in
~120,000 UK Biobank participants, <em>Sci Data</em> <strong>10</strong>, 64 (2023). doi:
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01949-y">10.1038/s41597-023-01949-y</a>
</p>


<h3>Methods for computing biomarker ratios</h3>

<p>The <code>compute_nightingale_ratios()</code> function will compute the
<a href="https://research.nightingalehealth.com/biomarkers/">81 Nightingale Health biomarker ratios</a>
that were missing prior to the August 2021 update of
<a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=220">UK Biobank</a>.
A companion function, <code>compute_nightingale_ratio_qc_flags()</code> will
aggregate the QC flags for the biomarkers underlying each ratio.
</p>
<p>The <code>compute_extended_ratios()</code> function will compute an extended
set of biomarker ratios expanding on the biomarkers available directly from
the Nightingale platform. A companion function, <code>compute_extended_ratio_qc_flags()</code>,
will aggregate the QC flags for the biomarkers underlying each ratio.
</p>
<p>The <code>recompute_derived_biomarkers()</code> function will recompute all
composite biomarkers and ratios from 107 non-derived biomarkers, which is
useful for ensuring data consistency when adjusting for unwanted biological
variation. A companion function, <code>recompute_derived_biomarker_qc_flags()</code> will
aggregate the QC flags for the biomarkers underlying each composite biomarker
and ratio.
