<h2>ufRisk: A package for user friendly and practical usage of various
backtesting methods.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The goal of the <code>ufRisk</code> package (univariate financial risk) is to
enable the user to compute one-step ahead forecasts of Value at Risk (VaR)
and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various parametric and semiparametric
GARCH-type models. For the latter the estimation of the nonparametric scale
function is carried out by means of a data-driven smoothing approach.
Currently the GARCH, the exponential GARCH (EGARCH), the Log-GARCH, the
asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH), the FIGARCH and FI-Log-GARCH can be employed
within the scope of <code>ufRisk</code>. Model quality, in terms of forecasting VaR
and ES, can be assessed by means of various backtesting methods.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>

<p><code>varcast</code> is a function to calculate rolling one-step ahead forecasts
of VaR and ES for a selection of parametric and semiparametric GARCH-type models (see also
<code>varcast</code>).
</p>
<p><code>trafftest</code> is a function for backtesting VaR and ES. ES is backtested
via a newly developed traffic light approach. (see also
<code>trafftest</code>).
</p>
<p><code>covtest</code> is a function for conducting the conditional and the
unconditional coverage tests introduced by Kupiec (1995) and Christoffersen
(1998). (see also <code>covtest</code>).
