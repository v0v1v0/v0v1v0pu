<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <b>ESOM</b>(emergent self organizing map) is an improvement of the regular <b>SOM</b>(self organizing map) which allows for toroid grids of neurons and is intended to be used in combination with the <b>Umatrix</b>. The set of neurons is referred to as <b>weights</b> within this package, as they represent the values within the high dimensional space. The neuron with smallest distance to a datapoint is called a <b>Bestmatch</b> and can be considered as projection of said datapoint. As the Umatrix is usually toroid, it is drawn four consecutive times to remove border effects. An island, or Imx, is a filter mask, which cuts out a subset of the Umatrix, which shows every point only a single time while avoiding border effects cutting through potential clusters.
Finally the Pmatrix shows the density structures within the grid, by a set radius. It can be combined with the Umatrix resulting in the UStarMatrix, which is therefore a combination of density based structures as well as clearly divided ones.
