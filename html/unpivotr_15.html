<h2>Divide a grid of cells into partitions containing individual tables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given the positions of corner cells that mark individual tables in a single
spreadsheet, <code>partion()</code> works out which table cells belong to which corner
cells.  The individual tables can then be worked on independently.
</p>
<p><code>partition()</code> partitions along both dimensions (rows and columns) at once.
<code>partition_dim()</code> partitions along one dimension at a time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">partition(cells, corners, align = "top_left", nest = TRUE, strict = TRUE)

partition_dim(positions, cutpoints, bound = "upper")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cells</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame or tbl, the cells to be partitioned, from
<code>as_cells()</code> or <code>tidyxl::xlsx_cells()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corners</code></td>
<td>
<p>usually a subset of <code>cells</code>, being the corners of individual
tables.  Can also be cells that aren't among <code>cells</code>, in which case see the
<code>strict</code> argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>align</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character, the position of the corner cells relative to their
tables, one of <code>"top_left"</code> (default), <code>"top_right"</code>, <code>"bottom_left"</code>,
<code>"bottom_right"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nest</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether to nest the partitions in a list-column of data
frames.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strict</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, whether to omit partitions that don't contain a corner
cell.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>positions</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer vector, the positions of cells (either the row
position or the column position), which are to be grouped between
cutpoints.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutpoints</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer vector. The <code>positions</code> will be separated into
groups either side of each cutpoint.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bound</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of <code>"upper"</code> or <code>"lower"</code>, controls whether cells that lie
on a cutpoint are should be grouped with cells below or above the cutpoint.
For example, if column 5 is a cutpoint, and a cell is in column 5,
<code>"lower"</code> would group it with cells in columns 1 to 4, whereas <code>"upper"</code>
would group it with cells in columns 6 to 10.  This is so that you can use
cells at the bottom or the right-hand side of a table as the cutpoints
(either of which would be 'upper' bounds because row and column numbers
count from 1 in the top-left row and column).  When <code>"upper"</code>, any
<code>cell_positions</code> above the first cutpoint will be in group 0; when
<code>"lower"</code>, any <code>cell_positions</code> below the final cutpoint will be 0.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>partition_dim()</code> returns an integer vector, numbering the groups of
cells.  Group 0 represents the cells above the first cutpoint (when <code>bound = "upper"</code>), or below the first cutpoint (when <code>bound = "lower"</code>).  The
other groups are numbered from 1, where group 1 is adjacent to group 0.
</p>
<p><code>partition_dim()</code> returns an integer vector, numbering the groups of cells.
Group 0 represents the cells above the first cutpoint (when <code>bound = "upper"</code>), or below the first cutpoint (when <code>bound = "lower"</code>).  The other
groups are numbered from 1, where group 1 is adjacent to group 0.  Divide a
grid of cells into chunks along both dimensions

<h3>Functions</h3>


<ul><li> <p><code>partition_dim()</code>: Divide a grid of cells into chunks along one dimension
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The `purpose` dataset, represented in four summary tables
multiples &lt;- purpose$small_multiples
rectify(multiples, character, numeric)

# The same thing in its raw 'melted' form that can be filtered
multiples

# First, find the cells that mark a corner of each table
corners &lt;-
  dplyr::filter(multiples,
                !is.na(character),
                !(character %in% c("Sex", "Value", "Female", "Male")))

# Then find out which cells fall into which partition
partition(multiples, corners)

# You can also use bottom-left corners (or top-right or bottom-right)
bl_corners &lt;- dplyr::filter(multiples, character == "Male")
partition(multiples, bl_corners, align = "bottom_left")

# To complete the grid even when not all corners are supplied, use `strict`
bl_corners &lt;- bl_corners[-1, ]
partition(multiples, bl_corners, align = "bottom_left")
partition(multiples, bl_corners, align = "bottom_left", strict = FALSE)
# Given a set of cells in rows 1 to 10, partition them at the 3rd, 5th and 7th
# rows.
partition_dim(1:10, c(3, 5, 7))

# Given a set of cells in columns 1 to 10, partition them at the 3rd, 5th and
# 7th column.  This example is exactly the same as the previous one, to show
# that the function works the same way on columns as rows.
partition_dim(1:10, c(3, 5, 7))

# Given a set of cells in rows 1 to 10, partition them at the 3rd, 5th and
# 7th rows, aligned to the bottom of the group.
partition_dim(1:10, c(3, 5, 7), bound = "lower")

# Non-integer row/column numbers and cutpoints can be used, even though they
# make no sense in the context of partioning grids of cells.  They are
# rounded towards zero first.
partition_dim(1:10 - .5, c(3, 5, 7))
partition_dim(1:10, c(3, 5, 7) + 1.5)
