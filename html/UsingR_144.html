<h2> Southern Oscillations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The southern oscillation is defined as the barametric pressure
difference between Tahiti and the Darwin Islands at sea level. The
southern oscillation is a predictor of el nino which in turn is
thought to be a driver of world-wide weather. Specifically, repeated
southern oscillation values less than -1 typically defines an el nino.
