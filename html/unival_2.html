SAS3f database
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A database to be used as example in the functions included on <code>unival</code> package. It contains the criterion, the primary factor scores and the general factor scores obtained using the program FACTOR. Those scores were obtained used a dataset of 238 responders to the Statistical Anxiety Scale (Vigil-Colet, Lorenzo-Seva, &amp; Condon, 2008). For clarification: it does not contain the raw scores from the participant's answers to the test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("SAS3f")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 238 observations and 5 variables, corresponding to the criterion, the primary factor scores and the general factor score.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original test contains 24 items and measures 3 different anxiety subscales: Examination Anxiety , Asking for Help Anxiety and Interpretation Anxiety. Since they are highly correlated, they were considered related subscales from an overall scale, which measures statistical anxiety.
</p>
<p>Since the package <code>unival</code> was designed for working with the factor scores and not the raw data, the provided datasets include the factor scores instead the raw data. It also contains a criterion, which in this case are the marks obtained by the responders on an Statistical exam.
