<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset excerpts some interesting variables from the NPDB for the
years 2000-2003. The question of capping medical malpractice awards to
lower insurance costs is currently being debated nationwide
(U.S.). This data is a primary source for determining this debate.
</p>
<p>A quotation from  <a href="https://npdb-hipdb.com/">https://npdb-hipdb.com/</a>:
</p>
<p>“The legislation that led to the creation of the NPDB was
enacted the U.S. Congress believed that the increasing occurrence of
medical malpractice litigation and the need to improve the quality of medical
care had become nationwide problems that warranted greater efforts than
any individual State could undertake. The intent is to improve the
quality of health care by encouraging State licensing boards, hospitals
and other health care entities, and professional societies to identify
and discipline those who engage in unprofessional behavior; and to
restrict the ability of incompetent physicians, dentists, and other
health care practitioners to move from State to State without disclosure
or discovery of previous medical malpractice payment and adverse action
history. Adverse actions can involve licensure, clinical privileges,
professional society membership, and exclusions from Medicare and
Medicaid.”
