<h2>Dataset due to Saunders</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataframe showing species inventories for a kelp holdfast
(<code>saunders</code>) including a Boolean flag indicating whether the
holdfast was in a sheltered or exposed location.
</p>
<p>Also two data frames, one for the 20 exposed holdfasts
(<code>saunders.exposed</code>) and one for the 20 sheltered holdfasts
(<code>saunders.sheltered</code>).
</p>
<p>Also three <code>count</code> objects, giving counts for all organisms
(<code>saunders.tot</code>), all those from exposed locations
(<code>saunders.exposed.tot</code>), and all those from sheltered locations
only (<code>saunders.sheltered.tot</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(saunders)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Dataset <code>saunders</code> is a dataframe with 40 observations on 177
variables.  Each row corresponds to a holdfast.  The first column is
Boolean, indicating whether or not that holdfast was exposed
(<code>TRUE</code>) or sheltered (<code>FALSE</code>).  The other columns show
species abundances for each of 176 species.
</p>
<p>Summary datasets <code>saunders.sheltered.tot</code>,
<code>saunders.exposed.tot</code>, and <code>saunders.tot</code> are objects of
class <code>count</code> that are the species abundance for sheltered
holdfasts, exposed holdfasts, and the entire dataset.
</p>
<p>The user will probably be most interested in <code>saunders.sheltered</code>
and <code>saunders.exposed</code>, which are the <strong>transpose</strong> of the
appropriate rows of <code>saunders</code>.  Thus these dataframes have 176
rows, one per species and 20 rows, one per holdfast.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Kelp are large seaweeds classified in kingdom Chromista.  Kelp grows
in shallow oceans in kelp forests.
</p>
<p>The <dfn>holdfast</dfn> is a root-like structure that anchors the kelp to
the ocean floor.  Fauna inhabiting kelp holdfasts, being
“incredibly diverse” (Anderson et al 2005), are often used as
indicators of environmental change.
</p>
<p>The data was collected in New Zealand, from eight sites along the
Leigh coastline from north of Leigh Harbour down to the southern end
of Kawau Island (a stretch of roughly 20 km).  Four sites were
wave-exposed, four were sheltered (although two of the latter were
arguably quite tidally-dominated).  Each site had a spatial extent of
roughly one hectare.  They were collected from 5 - 10 November, 2003.
</p>
<p>The <code>saunders</code> dataset must be arranged as it is because if it
were transposed, the first row would be the (nonsensical) observation
<code>c(T,T,...,T,F,...,F)</code>.   
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It is not entirely obvious how to derive the summary datasets from the
<code>saunders</code> dataframe.  Use function <code>extractor()</code> for this.
