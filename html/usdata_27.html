<h2>Predicting who would vote for NSA Mass Surveillance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In 2013, the House of Representatives voted to not stop the National
Security Agency's (NSA's) mass surveillance of phone behaviors. We look at
two predictors for how a representative voted: their party and how much
money they have received from the private defense industry.
