<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If you have a distance matrix, and the objects are partitioned into groups,
you might like to know the distance between the group centroids. The
centroid of each group is simply the center of mass for the group.
</p>
<p>It is possible to infer the distance between group centroids directly from
the distances between items in each group.  The <code>adonis</code> test in the
ecology package <code>vegan</code> takes advantage of this approach to carry out
an ANOVA-like test on distances.
</p>
<p>The approach rests on the assumption that the objects occupy some
high-dimensional Euclidean space.  However, we do not have to actually
create the space to find the distance between centroids.  Based on the
assumption that such a space exists, we can use an algebraic formula to
perform the computation.
</p>
<p>The formulas for this were presented by Apostol and Mnatsakanian in 2003,
though we need to re-arrange equation 28 in their paper to get the value
we want:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">| c_1 - c_2 | = \sqrt{
   \frac{1}{n_1 n_2} \sum_{(1,2)} -
   \frac{1}{n_1^2} \sum_{(1)} -
   \frac{1}{n_2^2} \sum_{(2)}},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">n_1</code> is the number of samples in group 1, <code class="reqn">\sum_{(1)}</code> is the
sum of squared distances between items in group 1, and <code class="reqn">\sum_{(1,2)}</code> is
the sum of squared distances between items in group 1 and those in group 2.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the distance between centroids is not a real number, because it
is not possible to create a space where this distance exists. Mathematically,
we get a negative number underneath the square root in the equation above.
If this happens, the function returns <code>NaN</code>. If you'd like to have
access to this value, you can set <code>squared = TRUE</code> to return the
squared distance between centroids. In this case, you will never get
<code>NaN</code>, but you might receive negative numbers in your result.
</p>
