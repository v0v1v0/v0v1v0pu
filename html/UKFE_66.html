<h2>Non-flood adjustment for pooling groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Applies the NonFloodAdj function to adjust the LCV and LSKEW of one or more sites in a pooling group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NonFloodAdjPool(x, Index = NULL, AutoP = NULL, ReturnStats = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A pooling group, derived from the Pool() or PoolSmall() functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Index</code></td>
<td>
<p>An vector of indices (row numbers) of sites to be adjusted. If Index = NULL (the default) the function is applied to all sites.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AutoP</code></td>
<td>
<p>A percentage (numeric) of non flood years. Any sites in the group exceeding this value will be adjusted. This is an automated approach so that the user doesn't need to specify Index. If no sites are above AutoP, the function is applied to all sites.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ReturnStats</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical with a default of FALSE. If set to TRUE, a dataframe of non-flood year stats is returned (see 'Value' section below) instead of the adjusted Pooling group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For more details of the method for individual sites see the details section of the NonFloodAdj function. As a default this function applies NonFloodAdj to every member of the pooling group. Index can be supplied which is the row name/s of the members you wish to adjust. Or AutoP can be applied and is a percentage. Any member with a greater percentage of non-flood years than AutoP is then adjusted.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>By default the pooling group is returned with adjusted LCVs and LSKEWs for all sites indexed (or all sites when Index = NULL), or all sites with percentage of non-flood years above AutoP. No difference will be seen for sites with no AMAX &lt; 0.5QMED. If ReturnStats is set to TRUE, a dataframe with Non-flood year stats is returned. The dataframe has a row for each site in the pooling group and three columns. The forst the number of non-flood years, the second is the number of years, and the third is the associated percentage.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Set up a pooling group for site 44013. Then apply the function.
Pool44013 &lt;- Pool(GetCDs(44013))
PoolNF &lt;- NonFloodAdjPool(Pool44013)
#return the non flood stats for the pooling group
NonFloodAdjPool(Pool44013, ReturnStats = TRUE)
</code></pre>
