<h2>Performance of an Oracle database used for online transaction processing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing performance data for an Oracle OLTP database measured
between 8:00am and 8:00pm on January, 19th 2012. The measurements were
recorded for two minute intervals during this time and a timestamp indicates
the end of the measurement interval. The performance metrics were taken from
the <code>v$sysmetric</code> family of system performance views.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 360 rows on 8 variables
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Oracle database was running on a 4-way server.
</p>
<p>The data frame contains different types of measurements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Variables of the "time" type are expressed in seconds per second.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Variables of the "rate" type are expressed in events per second.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Variables of the "util" type are expressed as a percentage.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data frame contains the following variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>timestamp</code> The end of the two minute interval for which the
remaining variables contain the measurements.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>db_time</code> The time spent inside the database either working on
a CPU or waiting  (I/O, locks, buffer waits ...). This time is expressed
as seconds per second, so two sessions working for exactly one second
each will contribute a total of two seconds per second of <code>db_time</code>.
In Oracle this value is also known as <em>Average Active Sessions</em>
(AAS).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cpu_time</code> The CPU time used during the interval. This is also
expressed as seconds per second. A 4-way machine has a theoretical
capacity of four CPU seconds per second.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>call_rate</code> The number of user calls (logins, parses, or
execute calls) per second.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>exec_rate</code> The number of statement executions per second.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lio_rate</code> The number of logical I/Os per second. A logical
I/O is the Oracle term for a cache hit in the database buffer cache.
This metric does not indicate if an additional physical I/O was
necessary to load the buffer from disk.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>txn_rate</code> The number of database transactions per second.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cpu_util</code> The CPU utilization of the database server in
percent. This was also measured from within the database.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
