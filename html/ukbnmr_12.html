<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A multi-step procedure (version 1) is applied to the raw biomarker data to
remove the effects of technical variation:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>First biomarker data is filtered to the 107 biomarkers that
cannot be derived from any combination of other biomarkers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolute concentrations are log transformed, with a small offset
applied to biomarkers with concentrations of 0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for the time between sample preparation
and sample measurement (hours).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for systematic differences between rows
(A-H) on the 96-well shipment plates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for remaining systematic differences
between columns (1-12) on the 96-well shipment plates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biomarker is adjusted for drift over time within each of the six
spectrometers. To do so, samples are grouped into 10 bins, within each
spectrometer, by the date the majority of samples on their respective
96-well plates were measured.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regression residuals after the sequential adjustments are
transformed back to absolute concentrations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samples belonging to shipment plates that are outliers of
non-biological origin are identified and set to missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 61 composite biomarkers and 81 biomarker ratios are recomputed
from their adjusted parts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional 76 biomarker ratios of potential biological
significance are computed.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At each step, adjustment for technical covariates is performed using
robust linear regression. Plate row, plate column, and
sample measurement date bin are treated as factors, using the group with the
largest sample size as reference in the regression.
</p>
<p>Further details can be found in Ritchie S. C. <em>et al.</em> Quality control
and removal of technical variation of NMR metabolic biomarker data in
~120,000 UK Biobank participants, <em>Sci Data</em> <strong>10</strong>, 64 (2023). doi:
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01949-y">10.1038/s41597-023-01949-y</a>
</p>
<p>Version 2 of the algorithm (the default) modifies the above procedure to (1)
adjust for well and column within each processing batch separately in steps 4
and 5, and (2) in step 6 instead of splitting samples into 10 bins per
spectrometer uses a fixed bin size of approximately 2,000 samples per bin,
ensuring samples measured on the same plate and plates measured on the same
day are grouped into the same bin.
</p>
<p>The first modification was made as applying version 1 of the algorithm
revealed introduced stratification by well position when examining the
corrected concentrations in each data release separately.
</p>
<p>The second modification was made to ensure consistent bin sizes across data
releases when correcting for drift over time. Otherwise, spectrometers used
in multiple data releases would have different bin sizes when adjusting
different releases. A bin split is also hard coded on spectrometer 5 between
plates 0490000006726 and 0490000006714 which correspond to a large change in
concentrations akin to a spectrometer recalibration event most strongly
observed for alanine concentrations.
</p>
<p>This function takes 20-30 minutes to run and requires at least 14 GB of RAM.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>list</code> containing three <code>data.frames</code>: </p>

<dl>
<dt>biomarkers</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with column names "eid",
and "visit_index", containing project-specific sample identifier and
UK Biobank visit index (0 for baseline assessment, 1 for first repeat
assessment), followed by columns for each biomarker containing their
absolute concentrations (or ratios thereof) adjusted for technical
variation. See <code>nmr_info</code> for information on each biomarker.</p>
</dd>
<dt>biomarker_qc_flags</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with the same format as
<code>biomarkers</code> with entries corresponding to the
<a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=221">quality
control indicators</a> for each sample. "High plate outlier" and "Low
plate outlier" indicate the value was set to missing due to systematic
abnormalities in the biomarker's concentration on the sample's shipment
plate compared to all other shipment plates (see Details). For
composite and derived biomarkers, quality control flags are aggregates
of any quality control flags for the underlying biomarkers from which
the composite biomarker or ratio is derived.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sample_processing</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing the
<a href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=222">processing
information and quality control indicators</a> for each sample, including
those derived for removal of unwanted technical variation by this
function. See <code>sample_qc_info</code> for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>log_offset</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing diagnostic information on
the offset applied so that biomarkers with concentrations of 0 could
be log transformed, and any right shift applied to prevent negative
concentrations after rescaling adjusted residuals back to absolute
concentrations. Should contain only biomarkers with minimum
concentrations of 0 (in the "Minimum" column). "Minimum.Non.Zero"
gives the smallest non-zero concentration for the biomarker.
"Log.Offset" the small offset added to all samples prior to
log transformation: half the mininum non-zero concentration.
"Right.Shift" gives the small offset added to prevent negative
concentrations that arise after rescaling residuals to log
concentrations: this should be at least one order of magnitude
smaller than the smallest non-zero value (i.e. the offset added
should amount to noise in numeric precision for all samples). See
publication for more details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>outlier_plate_detection</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing diagnostic
information and details of outlier plate detection. For each of the
107 non-derived biomarkers, the median concentration on each of the
1,352 plates was calculated, then plates were flagged as outliers if
their median value deviated more than expected from the mean of plate
medians. "Mean.Plate.Medians" gives the mean of the plate medians for
each biomarker. "Lower.Limit" and "Upper.Limit" give the values below
and above which plates are flagged as outliers based on their plate
median. See publication for more details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>algorithm_version</dt>
<dd>
<p>Version of the algorithm run, currently either 1
or 2.</p>
