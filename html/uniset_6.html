<h2>Perform Setup</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform the required setup to enable the target package to make
use of the functionality of package 'uniset'. Only has to be called once
by the user of the target package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">uniset_setup(where = NULL, uniset_handover)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character length one, holding the path to the location where the
folder containing the settings.R file should be located. Defaults to 'NULL'.
If left at the default 'NULL', the location should be selectable interactively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>uniset_handover</code></td>
<td>
<p>List length two, containing two elements:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>pkgname</code>: The name of the target package.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>funcname</code>: The name of the function in the target package handing over
the required values. See examples at <code>uniset</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is intended to be called from <strong>within</strong> the
target package by the user of the target package. Only has to be called once
to initiate the system, i.e. to
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Define the folder where the settings.R file will be located,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Copy the settings.R file into this folder, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Create a corresponding entry in the .Renviron file (or create the
.Renviron file if does not exist).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup has to be done manually (but only once!) by the user of the target
package. However, if called repeatedly, it enables the user of the target
package to conveniently change the settings-home directory and its
corresponding variable in the .Renviron file. In that case, a factory-fresh
version of the settings.R file will be copied into the new settings-home
directory. For the user-defined values in the 'old' settings.R file not
to be lost, the user then has to manually move / copy the settings from
the old location to the new one.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Called for its side effects, i.e. to initiate the dynamic settings file
system (see Details.) Returns an (invisible) character length one holding the
path to the settings-home directory.
</p>


<h3>Important</h3>

<p>This function is meant to be called from within the
target package.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">{
## Not run: 
# to be called from within the target package
uniset_setup(where, uniset_handover)

## End(Not run)
}
</code></pre>
