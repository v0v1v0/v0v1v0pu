<h2>Structures For Tracking Global Options</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Immplemented as S4 classes just so we can ensure everything is guaranteed
to have the right slots.  This is done by defining a virtual class that has
a validity function that checks the required slots exist.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Not we don't use "ANY" slots here because that would allow partially
specified sub classes (i.e. classes with slots that are "ANY"), which we
do not want to allow.
</p>
<p><code>unitizerGlobalTrackingStore</code> is used to keep "compressed" versions of
<code>unitizerGlobal$tracking</code>.  The compressed versions obviously lose some
information.  In particular, environments or things that have environments
as parents, or large objects, are not stored and instead a reference to
a <code>unitizerDummy</code> object is stored.  This object unambiguously
identifies a non-stored object since no user or system code should
normally creating a <code>unitizerDummy</code> object.
</p>
<p><code>unitizerGlobalState</code> tracks a single state which is just one value from
each of the slots of <code>unitizerGlobalTrackingStore</code>
</p>
<p>When comparing state between new and reference tests, only explicitly stored
items are compared (though any extra or missing items may be brought up as
possible mismatches).
