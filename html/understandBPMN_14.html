<h2>Path and repetition log</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns a list with four or three nested list objects:
- One for the paths:
Assumption: if a path contains a loop, the path contains one repetition (so two times) of the execution of this loop
Assumption: there is no difference made between the type of gateways.
So the path log is not a path log according to the definition found in the literature, but more a kind of a path log
Assumption: for each split and join in the log, an extra element is added with the name "split" or "join"
- One list object for the loops (repetitions) which start with a join and end with a join
- One list object for the loops (repetitions) which start with a split and end with a split
( - One list for the paths in which all gateways have a certain type)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>
