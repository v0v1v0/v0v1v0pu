<h2>Default configuration for umap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list with parameters customizing a UMAP embedding. Each component of the
list is an effective argument for umap().
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">umap.defaults
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>umap.config</code> of length 22.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>n_neighbors: integer; number of nearest neighbors
</p>
<p>n_components: integer; dimension of target (output) space
</p>
<p>metric: character or function; determines how distances between
data points are computed. When using a string, available metrics are:
euclidean, manhattan. Other available generalized metrics are: cosine,
pearson, pearson2. Note the triangle inequality may not be satisfied by
some generalized metrics, hence knn search may not be optimal.
When using metric.function as a function, the signature must be
function(matrix, origin, target) and should compute a distance between
the origin column and the target columns
</p>
<p>n_epochs: integer; number of iterations performed during
layout optimization
</p>
<p>input: character, use either "data" or "dist"; determines whether the
primary input argument to umap() is treated as a data matrix or as a
distance matrix
</p>
<p>init: character or matrix. The default string "spectral" computes an initial
embedding using eigenvectors of the connectivity graph matrix. An
alternative is the string "random", which creates an initial layout based on
random coordinates. This setting.can also be set to a matrix, in which case
layout optimization begins from the provided coordinates.
</p>
<p>min_dist: numeric; determines how close points appear in the final layout
</p>
<p>set_op_ratio_mix_ratio: numeric in range [0,1]; determines who the knn-graph
is used to create a fuzzy simplicial graph
</p>
<p>local_connectivity: numeric; used during construction of fuzzy simplicial
set
</p>
<p>bandwidth: numeric; used during construction of fuzzy simplicial set
</p>
<p>alpha: numeric; initial value of "learning rate" of layout optimization
</p>
<p>gamma: numeric; determines, together with alpha, the learning rate of
layout optimization
</p>
<p>negative_sample_rate: integer; determines how many non-neighbor points are
used per point and per iteration during layout optimization
</p>
<p>a: numeric; contributes to gradient calculations during layout optimization.
When left at NA, a suitable value will be estimated automatically.
</p>
<p>b: numeric; contributes to gradient calculations during layout optimization.
When left at NA, a suitable value will be estimated automatically.
</p>
<p>spread: numeric; used during automatic estimation of a/b parameters.
</p>
<p>random_state: integer; seed for random number generation used during umap()
</p>
<p>transform_state: integer; seed for random number generation used during
predict()
</p>
<p>knn: object of class umap.knn; precomputed nearest neighbors
</p>
<p>knn.repeat: number of times to restart knn search
</p>
<p>verbose: logical or integer; determines whether to show progress messages
</p>
<p>umap_learn_args: vector of arguments to python package umap-learn
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># display all default settings
umap.defaults

# create a new settings object with n_neighbors set to 5
custom.settings = umap.defaults
custom.settings$n_neighbors = 5
custom.settings
