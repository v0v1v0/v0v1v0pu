<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Quoting from the data source

</p>
<p>“On May 22, 2003, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed
tax legislation that included \$320 billion in tax cuts. The final tax
cut bill was signed into law by President Bush on May 28, 2003. The
largest component of the new tax law is the reduction of tax rates on
both capital gains and dividend income. The law also includes the
acceleration of future tax cuts, as well as new tax reductions for
businesses.
</p>
<p>This capital gains and dividend tax cut will have virtually no impact
on the average American. The vast majority of Americans (88
no capital gains on their tax returns. These taxpayers will receive
no tax savings at all from the reduction in taxes on capital
gains. Similarly, most Americans (75
from the reduction of taxes on dividends.
</p>
<p>While the average American will derive little, if any, benefit from the
cuts in dividend and capital gains taxes, the law offers significant
benefits to the wealthy. For example, the top 1
receive an average tax cut of almost \$21,000 each. In particular, some
of the major beneficiaries of this plan will be Vice President Cheney,
President Bush, and other members of the cabinet. Based on 2001 and 2002
dividends and capital gains income, Vice President Cheney, President
Bush, and the cabinet are estimated to receive an average tax cut of at
least \$42,000 per year. Their average tax savings equals the median
household income in the United States.”
