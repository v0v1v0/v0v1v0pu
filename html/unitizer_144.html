<h2>Return Values and Related Methods for <code>unitize</code> Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>unitize</code> and related functions are run primarily for the interactive
environment they provide and for their side effects (updating stored
<code>unitizer</code> objects), but the return values may be useful under some
circumstances if you need to retrieve test status, user selections, etc..
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'unitizer_result'
print(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'unitizer_results'
print(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the object to print</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>extra arguments for print generic</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>unitize</code> and <code>review</code> return a <code>unitizer_result</code> S3 object.
This is a data frame that contains details about the status of each test.
<code>unitize_dir</code> returns a <code>unitize_results</code> S3 object, which is a
list of <code>unitize_result</code>  objects.
</p>
<p>Both <code>unitize_results</code> and <code>unitize_result</code> have <code>print</code>
methods documented here. In addition to the <code>print</code> methods, both of
the result objects have <code>get_unitizer</code> methods so that you can
retrieve the stored <code>unitizer</code> objects.
</p>
<p>Please note that with <code>unitize_dir</code> you can re-review a single
<code>unitizer</code> several times during during a single call to
<code>unitize_dir</code>.  This is to allow you to re-evaluate specific
<code>unitizers</code> easily without having to re-run the entire directory again.
Unfortunately, as a result of this feature, the return values of
<code>unitize_dir</code> can be misleading because they only report the result of
the last review cycle.
</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>unitize_dir</code> will report user selections during the last
review even if in the end the user chose not to save the modified
<code>unitizer</code>.  You will be alerted to this by an onscreen message from the
<code>print</code> method (this is tracked in the "updated" attribute of the
<code>unitizer_result</code> object).  Finally, if in the last iteration before
exit you did not save the <code>unitizer</code>, but you did save it in  previous
review cycles in the same <code>unitize_dir</code> call, the displayed selections
and test outcomes will correspond to the last unsaved iteration, not the
one that was saved.  You will be alerted to this by an on-screen message
(this is tracked through the "updated.at.least.once" attribute of the
<code>unitizer_result</code> object).
