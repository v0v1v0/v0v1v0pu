<h2>Number of Albatrosses accidentaly caught during a fishing haul</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set from Hillborn and Mangel contains data on the number of
Albatrosses accidentally caught while fishing by commercial
fisheries. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(bycatch)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>no.albatross</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of albatross caught</p>
</dd>
<dt>no.hauls</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of hauls with this many albatross caught</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>During fishing operations non-target species are often captured. These
are called “incidental catch”. In some cases, large-scale observer
programs are used to monitor this incidental catch.
</p>
<p>When fishing for squid, albatrosses are caught while feeding on the
squid at the time of fising. This feeding is encouraged while the net
is being hauled in, as the squid are clustered making it  an opportunistic
time for the albatross to eat.
