<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Package for time series modelling and forecasting of 
times series models inspired on different sources:
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Unobserved Components models due to A.C. Harvey (Basic Structural Model: BSM), enhanced with automatic identification 
tools by Diego J. Pedregal. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ExponenTial Smoothing by R.J. Hyndman and colaborators.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ARIMA models by V. Gómez and A. Maravall
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Tobit ETS models by Pedregal, Trapero and Holgado
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The package is designed for automatic identification 
among a wide range of possible models. The models may include exogenous variables. ARMA irregular components 
and automatic detection of outliers in some instances.
