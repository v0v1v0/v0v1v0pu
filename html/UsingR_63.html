<h2> Galton's height data for parents and children</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data set from tabulated data set used by Galton in 1885 to study the
relationship between a parent's height and their childrens.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(galton)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 928 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>child</dt>
<dd>
<p>The child's height</p>
</dd>
<dt>parent</dt>
<dd>
<p>The “midparent” height</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The midparent's height is an average of the fathers height and 1.08 times
the mother's. In the data there are 205 different parents and 928 children.
The data here is truncated at the ends for both parents and
children so that it can be treated as numeric data. The data were
tabulated and consequently made discrete. The <code>father.son</code> data set is
similar data used by Galton and is continuous.
