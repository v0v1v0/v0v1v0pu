<h2>Reversal-anchored averaging estimators for Up-and-Down</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dose-averaging target estimation for Up-and-Down experiments, historically the most popular approach, but not recommended as primary nowadays. Provided for completeness.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reversmean(
  x,
  y,
  rstart = 3,
  all = TRUE,
  before = FALSE,
  maxExclude = 1/3,
  full = FALSE
)

reversals(y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector: sequence of administered doses, treatments, stimuli, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector: sequence of observed responses. Must be same length as <code>x</code> or shorter by 1, and must be coded <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> or 0/1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rstart</code></td>
<td>
<p>the reversal point from which the averaging begins. Default 3, considered a good compromise between performance and robustness. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: from the starting point onwards, should all values of <code>x</code> be used (<code>TRUE</code>, default), or only reversal points as in the Wetherill et al. approach?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>before</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: whether to start the averaging one step earlier than the starting reversal point. Default <code>FALSE</code>, and ignored when <code>all=FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxExclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fraction in <code class="reqn">0,1</code> indicating the maximum initial fraction of the vector <code>x</code> to exclude from averaging, in case the algorithm-identified starting point occurs too late in the experiment. Default 1/3.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>full</code></td>

<p>logical: should more detailed information be returned, or only the estimate? (default <code>FALSE</code>)</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Up-and-Down designs (UDDs) allocate doses in a random walk centered nearly symmetrically around a balance point. Therefore, a modified average of allocated doses could be a plausible estimate of the balance point's location.
</p>
<p>During UDDs' first generation, a variety of dose-averaging estimators was developed, with the one proposed by Wetherill et al. (1966) eventually becoming the most popular. This estimator uses only doses observed at <em>reversal</em> points: points with a negative response following a positive one, or vice versa. More recent research (Kershaw 1985, 1987; Oron et al. 2022, supplement) strongly indicates that in fact it is better to use all doses starting from some cut-point, rather than skip most of them and choose only reversals.
</p>
<p>The <code>reversals()</code> utility identifies reversal points, whereas <code>reversmean()</code> produces a dose-averaging estimate whose starting cut-point is determined by a reversal. User can choose whether to use all doses from that cut-point onwards, or only the reversals as in the older approaches. A few additional options make the estimate even more flexible.
</p>
<p>More broadly, dose-averaging despite some advantages is not very robust, and also <strong>lacks an interval estimate with reliable coverage.</strong> Therefore, <code>reversmean()</code> provides neither a confidence interval nor a standard error.
</p>
<p>For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, available via <code>udest</code>, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to <code>cir::quickInverse()</code>. See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the <code>cir</code> package vignette.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>reversals()</code>, the indices of reversal points. For <code>reversmean()</code>, if <code>full=FALSE</code> returns the point estimate and otherwise returns a data frame with the estimate as well, as the index of the cutoff point used to start the averaging.

par(mar=c(4,4,4,1), mgp=c(2.5,0.8,0), cex.axis = 0.7, las = 1)
udplot(doses, responses, main='Van Elstraete et al. 2008 Study', 
       xtitle = "Patient Number", ytitle = 'Gabapentin (mg/kg)') 


#' Overlay the ED50 reported in the article (21.7 mg/kg):
abline(h = 21.7)

#' The authors cite a little-known 1991 article by Dixon as the method source.
#' However, in their author rejoinder they claim to have used the Dixon-Mood (1948) estimate.


# Our package does include the Dixon-Mood point estimate.
#  (w/o the CIs, because we do not endorse this estimation approach)
# Does it reproduce the article estimate?
dixonmood(doses, responses)

# Not at all! Let us overlay this one in red
abline(h = dixonmood(doses, responses), col=2)

# We have found that many articles claiming to use Dixon-Mood (or Dixon-Massey) actually
# Do something else. For example, in this article they report that 
#   "it is necessary to reject sequences with three to six identical results".
# Nothing like this appears in the original Dixon-Mood article, where the estimation method
#   involves identifying the less-common response (either 0 or 1), and using only x values
#   associated with these responses; obviating the need to exclude specific sequences.
#
# More generally, these historical estimates have long passed their expiry dates. 
#   Their foundation is not nearly as solid as, e.g., linear regression, 
#      and it's time to stop using them.

# That said, our package does offer two more types of dose-averaging estimates.
# Both are able to take advantage of the "n+1" dose-allocation, which is determined by
#    the last dose and response:
n = length(doses)
dosePlus1 = doses[n] + ifelse(responses[n]==0, 1, -1)
reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses)
# Interestingly, in this particular case the answer is very similar to the Dixon-Mood estimate.

# The `reversmean()` default averages all doses from the 3rd reversal point onwards.
# By the way, at what point did the third reversal happen? 
#     It'll be the 3rd number in this vector:
reversals(responses)

# Far more commonly in literature, particularly in sensory studies, 
#   one encounters the 1960s-era approach (led by Wetherill) of taking *only doses  
#   at reversal points, usually starting from the first one. `reversmean()` can do that too:
wetherill = reversmean(c(doses, dosePlus1), responses, all = FALSE, rstart = 1)
wetherill
# This one gives an even lower result than the previous ones.
abline(h = wetherill, col = 3)

# There's another approach to dose-averaging, although it is not in use anywhere that we know of.
# It does not require the y values at all. The underlying assumption is that the dose 
#   sequence has done enough meandering around the true balance point, to provide information
#   about where (approximately) the starting-dose effect is neutralized.
adaptmean(c(doses, dosePlus1))
# Again a bit curiously, this relatively recent approach gives a result similar to what
#   the authors reported (but not similar to the original Dixon-Mood).
# This is not too surprising, since here `adaptmean()` excludes the first one-third of doses,
#   which is approximately what happened if indeed the authors excluded all those long dose-increase
#   sequences at the start.

# All this shows how dicey dose-averaging, at face value a simple and effective method, can become.
# The sample size here is rather large for up-and-down studies, and yet because of the unlucky
#    choice of starting point (which in many studies, due to safety concerns cannot be evaded)
#    there is really no good option of which observations to exclude.

# This is one reason why we strongly recommend using Centered Isotonic Regression as default:
defest = udest(doses, responses, target = 0.5)
abline(h = defest$point, col = 'purple')
# For this dataset, it is the highest of all the estimates.
