<h2>PCLM-2D Akaike Information Criterion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generic function calculating Akaike's ‘An Information Criterion’ for
one or several fitted model objects for which a log-likelihood value
can be obtained, according to the formula
<code class="reqn">-2 \mbox{log-likelihood} + k n_{par}</code>,
where <code class="reqn">n_{par}</code> represents the number of parameters in the
fitted model, and <code class="reqn">k = 2</code> for the usual AIC, or
<code class="reqn">k = \log(n)</code>
(<code class="reqn">n</code> being the number of observations) for the so-called BIC or SBC
(Schwarz's Bayesian criterion).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'pclm2D'
AIC(object, ..., k = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fitted model object for which there exists a
<code>logLik</code> method to extract the corresponding log-likelihood, or
an object inheriting from class <code>logLik</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optionally more fitted model objects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric, the <em>penalty</em> per parameter to be used; the
default <code>k = 2</code> is the classical AIC.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When comparing models fitted by maximum likelihood to the same data,
the smaller the AIC or BIC, the better the fit.
</p>
<p>The theory of AIC requires that the log-likelihood has been maximized:
whereas AIC can be computed for models not fitted by maximum
likelihood, their AIC values should not be compared.
</p>
<p>Examples of models not ‘fitted to the same data’ are where the
response is transformed (accelerated-life models are fitted to
log-times) and where contingency tables have been used to summarize
data.
</p>
<p>These are generic functions (with S4 generics defined in package
<span class="pkg">stats4</span>): however methods should be defined for the
log-likelihood function <code>logLik</code> rather than these
functions: the action of their default methods is to call <code>logLik</code>
on all the supplied objects and assemble the results.  Note that in
several common cases <code>logLik</code> does not return the value at
the MLE: see its help page.
</p>
<p>The log-likelihood and hence the AIC/BIC is only defined up to an
additive constant.  Different constants have conventionally been used
for different purposes and so <code>extractAIC</code> and <code>AIC</code>
may give different values (and do for models of class <code>"lm"</code>: see
the help for <code>extractAIC</code>).  Particular care is needed
when comparing fits of different classes (with, for example, a
comparison of a Poisson and gamma GLM being meaningless since one has
a discrete response, the other continuous).
</p>
<p><code>BIC</code> is defined as
<code>AIC(object, ..., k = log(nobs(object)))</code>.
This needs the number of observations to be known: the default method
looks first for a <code>"nobs"</code> attribute on the return value from the
<code>logLik</code> method, then tries the <code>nobs</code>
generic, and if neither succeed returns BIC as <code>NA</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If just one object is provided, a numeric value with the corresponding
AIC (or BIC, or ..., depending on <code>k</code>).
</p>
<p>If multiple objects are provided, a <code>data.frame</code> with rows
corresponding to the objects and columns representing the number of
parameters in the model (<code>df</code>) and the AIC or BIC.
