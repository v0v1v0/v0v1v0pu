<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Scrabble is a popular board game based on forming words from the
players' pieces. These consist of letters drawn from a pile at
random. The game has a certain frequency of letters given by this
data. These match fairly well with the letter distribution of the
English language.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(scrabble)
## perform chi-squared analysis on long string. Is it in English?
quote = " R is a language and environment for statistical computing  \
and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language \
and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly   \
AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R    \
can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are      \
some important differences, but much code written for S runs         \
unaltered under R."
