<h2>Create an upkeep checklist in a GitHub issue</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This opens an issue in your package repository with a checklist of tasks for
regular maintenance of your package. This is a fairly opinionated list of
tasks but we believe taking care of them will generally make your package
better, easier to maintain, and more enjoyable for your users. Some of the
tasks are meant to be performed only once (and once completed shouldn't show
up in subsequent lists), and some should be reviewed periodically. The
tidyverse team uses a similar function <code>use_tidy_upkeep_issue()</code> for our
annual package Spring Cleaning.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">use_upkeep_issue(year = NULL)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>year</code></td>

Defaults to current year</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
