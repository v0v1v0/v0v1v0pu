<h2>Dynamic Settings File</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Any package (subsequently called 'target package') is enabled
to provide its users an easily accessible, user-friendly and human readable
text file where key=value pairs (used by functions defined in the target
package) can be saved. This settings file lives in a location defined by the
user of the target package, and its user-defined values remain unchanged even
when the author of the target package is introducing or deleting keys, or
when the target package is updated or re-installed. In order to enable the
target package to make use of the functionality offered by package 'uniset',
three files have to be exported by 'uniset' and placed into the target package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are two ways to generate the files required for the target
package to make use of 'uniset':
</p>

<dl>
<dt>-) Export and move manually</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use <code>uniset_getFiles</code>, then move
the 'xxx_settings.R' file ('xxx' for the name of the target package) into the
'inst' folder (create one if not already done) of the target package.
Move the files 'uniset_globals.R' and 'uniset_functions.R' into the
'R' folder of the target package.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-) Write directly to target package</dt>
<dd>
<p>(Recommended) Use
<code>uniset_copyFilesToPackage</code> to copy the required files directly into
the target package.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Every variable defined in the xxx_settings.R file is accessible in the code of
the target package. <br>
The target package has to list 'uniset' as an 'import', and then
<code>uniset_updateSettings</code> or <code>uniset_autoUpS</code> can be used
to manually or automatically update the settings,i.e. to read in the key=value
pairs stored in the xxx_settings.R file.

</p>


<h3>Advantage</h3>

<p>The most imminent advantage of the 'uniset' settings-file
system over using any static file for permanently storing settings for any
package is the fact that the key=value pairs in the xxx_settings.R
file get updated (added / deleted) dynamically. <br>
So the developer of a package can delete keys or introduce new ones, and
the new key=value pairs will be automatically added to or deleted from
the local xxx_settings.R file. <strong>Values changed by the user of the
target package will be preserved</strong>. <br>
So the author of the target package can add or delete keys from the
xxx_settings.R file without worrying that this will cause any effort or
troubles for the user of the target package.

<h3>Functions for preparing the target package</h3>

<p><code>uniset_copyFilesToPackage</code>, <code>uniset_getFiles</code>
</p>


<h3>Functions to be called from within the target package</h3>

<p><code>uniset_autoUpS</code>, <code>uniset_updateSettings</code>,
<code>uniset_test</code>,  <code>uniset_getstn</code>,
and only once: <code>uniset_setup</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>As the functions to update the settings file and to
(automatically) source this settings are intended to be called from
<strong>within</strong> the (installed) target package, please go to
<a href="https://bpollner.github.io/uniset/">https://bpollner.github.io/uniset/</a> for a walk-through and for
a real-life demonstration and examples how to use these functions
in the code of the target package.
