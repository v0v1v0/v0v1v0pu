<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with timestamp (half-hour intervals)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Field descriptions, source National Grid UK <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/uk">website</a>
</p>
<p>TIMESTAMP - a POSIXt object (if not aggregate to daily frequency and above), the time stamp of the series observations
</p>
<p>ND - National Demand is calculated as a sum of generation based on National Grid operational generation metering
</p>
<p>TSD - Transmission System Demand, This is the Transmission System generation requirement and is equivalent to the Initial Transmission System Outturn (ITSDO) and Transmission System Demand Forecast on BM Reports. Transmission System Demand is equal to the ND plus the additional generation required to meet station load, pump storage pumping and interconnector exports
</p>
<p>I014_TSD - Equivalent to TSD (above), but calculated using settlement metered generation data from the I014 file where available
</p>
<p>ENGLAND_WALES_DEMAND - England and Wales Demand, as ND above but on an England and Wales basis
</p>
<p>EMBEDDED_WIND_GENERATION - Estimated Embedded Wind Generation, This is an estimate of the GB wind generation from wind farms which do not have Transmission System metering installed. These wind farms are embedded in the distribution network and invisible to National Grid. Their effect is to suppress the electricity demand during periods of high wind. The true output of these generators is not known so an estimate is provided based on National Grid’s best model
</p>
<p>EMBEDDED_WIND_CAPACITY - Estimated Embedded Wind Capacity, This is National Grid’s best view of the installed embedded wind capacity in GB. This is based on publically available information compiled from a variety of sources and is not the definitive view. It is consistent with the generation estimate provided above
</p>
<p>EMBEDDED_SOLAR_GENERATION - Estimated Embedded Solar Generation, As embedded wind generation above, but for solar generation
</p>
<p>EMBEDDED_SOLAR_CAPACITY - Embedded Solar Capacity, As embedded wind capacity above, but for solar generation
</p>
