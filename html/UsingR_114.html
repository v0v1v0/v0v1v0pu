<h2>Simulated Data on Rate of Recruitment for Salmon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Ricker model is used to model the relationship of recruitment of a
salmon species versus the number of spawners. The model has two
parameters, a rate of growth at small numbers and a decay rate at large
numbers. This data set is simulated data for 83 different recordings
using parameters found in a paper by Chen and Holtby.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(salmon.rate)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is:
83 numbers on decay rates.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Ricker model for recruitment modeled by spawner count </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">R_t =
  S_t e^{a - bS_t}</code>
</p>
<p> The paramter <code class="reqn">b</code> is a decay rate
for large values of <code class="reqn">S</code>. In the paper by Chen and Holtby, they
studied 83 datasets and found that <code class="reqn">b</code> is log-normally distributed. The
data is simulated from their values to illustrate a log normal
distribution.
