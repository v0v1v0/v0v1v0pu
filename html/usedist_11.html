<h2>usedist: a package for working with distance matrices in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In usedist, we provide a number of functions to help with distance matrix
objects, such as those produced by the <code>dist</code> function.  Some functions
are geared towards making or altering distance matrix objects.  Others
relate to groups of items in the distance matrix. They provide access to
within- or between-group distances, or use these distances to infer the
distance to group centroids.
