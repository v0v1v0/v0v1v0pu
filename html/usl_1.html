<h2>Analyze system scalability with the Universal Scalability Law</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Universal Scalability Law is a model to predict hardware and software
scalability. It uses system capacity as a function of load to forecast the
scalability for the system.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Use the function <code>usl</code> to create a model from a formula and
a data frame.
</p>
<p>The USL model produces two coefficients as result: <code>alpha</code> models the
contention and <code>beta</code> the coherency delay of the system.
</p>
<p>The Universal Scalability Law has been created by Dr. Neil J. Gunther.
