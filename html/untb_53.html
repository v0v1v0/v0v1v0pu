<h2>Dataset due to Caruso</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataframe in standard format due to Migliorini and Caruso presenting
observations of oribatid mites.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(caruso)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Dataset <code>caruso</code> is a data frame with 194 observations on 5
variables.  Each row corresponds to a species; the observations (rows)
are the species abundances in each of 5 habitats.
</p>
<p>Following Migliorini et al 2002, the habitats were:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> a pure beech woodland (‘<code>Beech</code>’)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a coppice woodland (‘<code>Coppice</code>’)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> grassland (‘<code>Grassland</code>’)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> heathland (‘<code>Heathland</code>’)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Biancana’ badlands (‘<code>Biancana</code>’)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Oribatid mites are rather small and very interesting free living soil
microarthropods.  They have a huge species diversity with populations
characterised by highly aggregated distributions over multiple spatial
scales ranging from a few centimetres to hundreds of meters.
</p>
<p>Within each habitat, several soil samples were collected (five randomly
located replicates per each month: see the paper Migliorini et
al. 2002). So, actually, that is a network of small samples that make a
single large sample.
</p>
<p>The five study areas of this data set belong to five habitats that are
very typical of that Mediterranean region.  These five areas also
belong to a rather homogeneous biogeographical region (southern
Tuscany).  On the ground of what is known on the biology and community
patterns of Oribatida, several a-priori hypotheses can be made on
expected changes in the diversity of their assemblages and immigration
rates respectively between and within the five areas.  For instance,
under the Neutral Model one might expect that the Beech forest should
have the highest Theta and an immigration rate of about 1, while one
might expect the opposite for the Biancana (a very arid habitat, a kind
of gariga/garrigue with very patchy vegetation).

<p>Executing <code>optimal.params.sloss(caruso)</code> does not return
useful output.  The reason for this is unknown.</p>
