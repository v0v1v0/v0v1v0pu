<h2>Perform dictionary-based sentiment analysis on a tokenised data frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function identifies words which have a positive/negative meaning, with the addition of some basic logic regarding occurrences of amplifiers/deamplifiers and negators
in the neighbourhood of the word which has a positive/negative meaning.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If a negator is occurring in the neigbourhood, positive becomes negative or vice versa.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If amplifiers/deamplifiers occur in the neigbourhood, these amplifier weight is added to the sentiment polarity score.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This function took inspiration from qdap::polarity but was completely re-engineered to allow to calculate similar things on 
a udpipe-tokenised dataset. It works on a sentence level and the negator/amplification logic can not surpass a boundary defined
by the PUNCT upos parts of speech tag.<br></p>
<p>Note that if you prefer to build a supervised model to perform sentiment scoring 
you might be interested in looking at the ruimtehol R package <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol">https://github.com/bnosac/ruimtehol</a> instead.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">txt_sentiment(
  x,
  term = "lemma",
  polarity_terms,
  polarity_negators = character(),
  polarity_amplifiers = character(),
  polarity_deamplifiers = character(),
  amplifier_weight = 0.8,
  n_before = 4,
  n_after = 2,
  constrain = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame with the columns doc_id, paragraph_id, sentence_id, upos and the column as indicated in <code>term</code>. This is exactly what <code>udpipe</code> returns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>term</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string with the name of a column of <code>x</code> where you want to apply to sentiment scoring upon</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polarity_terms</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame containing terms which have positive or negative meaning. This data frame should contain the columns
term and polarity where term is of type character and polarity can either be 1 or -1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polarity_negators</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of words which will invert the meaning of the <code>polarity_terms</code> such that -1 becomes 1 and vice versa</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polarity_amplifiers</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of words which amplify the <code>polarity_terms</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>polarity_deamplifiers</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of words which deamplify the <code>polarity_terms</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>amplifier_weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>weight which is added to the polarity score if an amplifier occurs in the neighbourhood</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_before</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating how many words before the <code>polarity_terms</code> word one has to look to find negators/amplifiers/deamplifiers to apply its logic</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_after</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating how many words after the <code>polarity_terms</code> word one has to look to find negators/amplifiers/deamplifiers to apply its logic</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constrain</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating to make sure the aggregated sentiment scores is between -1 and 1</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list containing 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>data: the <code>x</code> data.frame with 2 columns added: polarity and sentiment_polarity. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The column polarity being just the polarity column of the <code>polarity_terms</code> dataset corresponding to the polarity of the <code>term</code> you apply the sentiment scoring 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The colummn sentiment_polarity is the value where the amplifier/de-amplifier/negator logic is applied on. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>overall: a data.frame with one row per doc_id containing the columns doc_id, sentences,
terms, sentiment_polarity, terms_positive, terms_negative, terms_negation and terms_amplification 
providing the aggregate sentiment_polarity score of the dataset <code>x</code> by doc_id as well as 
the terminology causing the sentiment, the number of sentences and the number of non punctuation terms in the document.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
