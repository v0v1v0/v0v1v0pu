<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Function to cluster species abundance with partition around medoids algorithm (Kaufman and Rousseuw. 1991).
By default, we propose the division into three clusters (k = 3),
which can have the convenient description of: "rare", "undetermined" and "abundant".
The phylogenetic units from the cluster with lowest median abundance is considered
to be the "rare biosphere".
</p>
<p><strong>The classification vector</strong>
</p>
<p>The classification vector (argument classification_vector) represents the
different clusters to be used, by ascending order of median abundance.
To change the number of clusters, change the number of elements in the
classification vector, <strong>but order matters!</strong> Depending on the number of clusters used,
you can change the meaning that best applies to your research.
</p>
<p>For example, you can use a classification vector with the designations: "very rare", "rare",
"abundant" and "very abundant"; which would apply a k = 4 underneath.
It is possible to use any number of clusters, as long as they are within 2 and
the maximum possible k.
</p>
<p>The maximum possible k is the number of different abundance scores observed in a single sample. Note, however,
that we do not recommend any clustering for k &gt; 10
and we also don't recommend k = 2 (we explain in more detail in Pascoal et al., 2023;
and in the vignette <code>vignette("explore-classifications")</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Automatic selection of the number of clusters</strong>
</p>
<p>To automatically decide the number of clusters (i.e., the value of k), it is possible to do so with the argument <strong>automatic=TRUE</strong>. For details on
complete automation of <code>define_rb()</code>, please see the documentation for <code>suggest_k()</code>. Briefly, the k with best average Silhouette score
is selected from a range of k values between 3 and 10. It is possible to decide k based on other indices ("Davies-Bouldin" or "Calinsky-Harabasz").
</p>
<p>If you want a more fine grained analysis of k values, we provide several functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>evaluate_k()</code>;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>check_avgSil()</code>;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>check_DB()</code>;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>check_CH()</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verify clustering results</strong>
</p>
<p>If half of the taxa of any cluster got a Silhouette score below 0.5 in any sample, then a warning is provided.
The warning provides the number of times this issue occurred.
You can inspect other alternatives to reduce the occurrences of a bad clustering,
but it is possible that, in some situations, you just can't find an optimal clustering.
</p>
<p>The detailed output gives you access to all of the clustering results:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>pam_object</code> is a list with the original results from the k-medoids clustering,
see <code>cluster::pam()</code> documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Level</code> is an integer indicating the specific cluster attributed by the <code>cluster::pam()</code>
function for each observation. Its order is random.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Silhouette_scores</code> provides the Silhouette score obtained for each
observation, i.e. a score for each taxa.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Cluster_median_abundance</code> provides the median taxa abundance of each cluster.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>median_Silhouette</code> provides the median Silhouette score obtained for each cluster.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Evaluation</code> indicates if the silhouette score obtained for a given observation
is below the median Silhouette of its cluster and sample.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make your own plots and analysis, but we also provide another function,
<code>plot_ulrb()</code>, which illustrates the results obtained.
</p>
<p><strong>Partition around medoids (pam)</strong>
</p>
<p>To calculate k-medoids, we used the partition around medoids (pam)
algorithm, which was described in Chapter 2 of "Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis."
(Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1991) and implemented by the cluster package with the <code>cluster::pam()</code> function.
</p>
<p>Briefly, the pam algorithm is divided into two main phases: <strong>build</strong> and <strong>swap</strong>.
</p>
<p>The first phase (<strong>build</strong>) selects k observations as cluster representatives. The first
observation selected as representative is the one that minimizes the sum of the dissimilarities to the
remaining observations. The second, third and so on repeat the same process, until k clusters have
been formed.
</p>
<p>The <strong>build</strong> steps are:
</p>
<p>1 - Propose a centroid with observation, <code class="reqn">i</code>, which has not been selected as a centroid yet
</p>
<p>2 - Calculate the distance between another observation, <code class="reqn">j</code>, and its most similar
observation, <code class="reqn">D_j</code>; and calculate the difference with the proposed centroid,
<code class="reqn">i</code>, i.e., <code class="reqn">d(j,i)</code>
</p>
<p>3 - If <code class="reqn">d(j,i) &gt; 0</code>, then calculate its contribution to the centroid:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">max(D_j - d(j,i),0)</code>
</p>

<p>4 - Calculate the total gain obtained by <code class="reqn">i</code>, </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum_{j}C_{ji}</code>
</p>

<p>5 - From all possible centroids, select the one that maximizes the previous total gain obtained,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">max_i \sum_jC_{ji}</code>
</p>

<p>6 - Repeat until k observations have been selected as cluster representatives.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the next phase, <strong>swap</strong>, is to improve the representatives
for the clusters. The principle is to swap the cluster representative between
all possibilities and calculate the value sum of dissimilarities between each
observation and the closest centroid. The swapping continues until no more improvement is
possible, i.e., when the minimum sum of dissimilarities of the clusters is reached.
</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:
</p>
<p>Understand that <strong>ulrb</strong> package considers each sample as an independent
community of phylogenetic units, which means clustering is also independent across
different samples.
Thus, be aware that you will have clustering results and metrics for each
single sample,
which is why we also provide some functions to analyze results across
any number of samples (see: <code>plot_ulrb()</code> for clustering results
and <code>evaluate_k()</code> for k selection).
