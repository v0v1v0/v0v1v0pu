<h2>Structuredness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Structuredness measures to which extent the process model can be divided into block structured structures (matching gateways)
Calculation: 1 - size of reduced process model / size of normal process model
To get the reduced process model, the following rules are applied:
-removal of trivial constructs (one incoming and one outgoing sequence flow)
-removal of matching gateways (for loops, this means first a join then a split, for all other gateways, it's the other way around)
-loops with other than XOR-gateways and non-matching gateways are kept
-gateways which are the consequence of multiple start or end events are removed
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">structuredness(file_path, signavio = FALSE,
  path_log_already_created = FALSE, generate_new_path_log = FALSE,
  time_to_generate_path_log = 1500)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>document object created using the create_internal_document function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>signavio</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean which indicates whether the file stems from signavio</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path_log_already_created</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean which indicates whether the path log has already been created before or not. When you are not sure, it is best to use the standard which is false</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>generate_new_path_log</code></td>
<td>
<p>used when it is not possible to save the path log such as with the Rapid miner or in unit tests and examples</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_to_generate_path_log</code></td>
<td>
<p>time which is the maximum time to generate a new path log in seconds. The standard setting is 1500 seconds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an integer indicating the structuredness
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
structuredness(file_path, generate_new_path_log = TRUE)
</code></pre>
