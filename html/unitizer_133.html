<h2>S4 Object To Implement Base List Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Internal <code>unitizer</code> objects used to manage lists of objects.  The only
user facing instance of these objects are <code>conditionList</code>
objects.  For the most part these objects behave like normal S3 lists.  The
list contents are kept in the <code>.items</code> slot, and the following methods
are implemented to make the object mostly behave like a standard R list:
<code>[</code>, <code>[[</code>, <code>[&lt;-</code>, <code>[[&lt;-</code>, <code>as.list</code>, <code>append</code>,
<code>length</code>, <code>names</code>, and <code>names&lt;-</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The underlying assumption is that the '.items' slot is a list
(or an expression), and that slot is the only slot for which
it's order and length are meaningful (i.e. there is no other list
or vector of same length as '.items' in a different slot that is
supposed to map to '.items').  This last assumption allows us
to implement the subsetting operators in a meaningful manner.
</p>
<p>The validity method will run <code>validObject</code> on the first, last, and
middle items (if an even number of items, then the middle closer to the
first) assuming they are S4 objects.  We don't run on every object to avoid
potentially expensive computation on all objects.
