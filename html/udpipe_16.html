<h2>Extract collocations - a sequence of terms which follow each other</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Collocations are a sequence of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance.
Common collocation are adjectives + nouns, nouns followed by nouns, verbs and nouns, adverbs and adjectives,
verbs and prepositional phrases or verbs and adverbs.<br>
This function extracts relevant collocations and computes the following statistics on them
which are indicators of how likely two terms are collocated compared to being independent.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> PMI (pointwise mutual information): log2(P(w1w2) / P(w1) P(w2))
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> MD (mutual dependency): log2(P(w1w2)^2 / P(w1) P(w2))
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LFMD (log-frequency biased mutual dependency): MD + log2(P(w1w2))
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As natural language is non random - otherwise you wouldn't understand what I'm saying, 
most of the combinations of terms are significant. That's why these indicators of collocation
are merely used to order the collocations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">keywords_collocation(x, term, group, ngram_max = 2, n_min = 2, sep = " ")

collocation(x, term, group, ngram_max = 2, n_min = 2, sep = " ")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame with one row per term where the sequence of the terms correspond to 
the natural order of a text. The data frame <code>x</code> should also contain 
the columns provided in <code>term</code> and <code>group</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>term</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector with 1 column from <code>x</code> which indicates the term</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector with 1 or several columns from <code>x</code> which indicates 
for example a document id or a sentence id. Collocations will be computed within this 
group in order not to find collocations across sentences or documents for example.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ngram_max</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating the size of the collocations. Defaults to 2, indicating
to compute bigrams. If set to 3, will find collocations of bigrams and trigrams.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_min</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating the frequency of how many times a collocation should
at least occur in the data in order to be returned. Defaults to 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string with the separator which will be used to <code>paste</code> together
terms which are collocated. Defaults to a space: ' '.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>a data.frame with columns 
</p>

<ul>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> right: the right term of the collocation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freq: the number of times the collocation occurred in the data
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freq_left: the number of times the left element of the collocation occurred in the data
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freq_right: the number of times the right element of the collocation occurred in the data
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pmi: the pointwise mutual information
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> md: mutual dependency
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lfmd: log-frequency biased mutual dependency
</p>
</li>
</ul>
