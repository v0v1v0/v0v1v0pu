<h2>Convert a <code>testthat</code> Test File to a <code>unitizer</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts a <b>copy</b> of an existing <code>testthat</code> test file to a
<code>unitizer</code> test file and test store, or a directory of such files to
a corresponding <code>unitizer</code> directory.  See examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">testthat_translate_file(
  file.name,
  target.dir = file.path(dirname(file.name), "..", "unitizer"),
  state = getOption("unitizer.state"),
  keep.testthat.call = TRUE,
  prompt = "always",
  interactive.mode = interactive(),
  use.sects = TRUE,
  unitize = TRUE,
  ...
)

testthat_translate_dir(
  dir.name,
  target.dir = file.path(dir.name, "..", "unitizer"),
  filter = "^test.*\\.[rR]",
  state = getOption("unitizer.state"),
  keep.testthat.call = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  interactive.mode = interactive(),
  use.sects = TRUE,
  unitize = TRUE,
  ...
)

testthat_translate_name(
  file.name,
  target.dir = file.path(dirname(file.name), "..", "unitizer"),
  name.new = NULL,
  name.pattern = "^(?:test\\W*)?(.*)(?:\\.[rR])$",
  name.replace = "\\1"
)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a file path or a character vector (see <code>target.dir</code>)
</p>


<h3>Disclaimers</h3>

<p>If you already have an extensive test suite in <code>testthat</code> and you do not
intend to modify your tests or code very much there is little benefit (and
likely some drawbacks) to migrating your tests to <code>unitizer</code>.  Please
see the introduction vignette for a (biased) view of the pros and cons of
<code>unitizer</code> relative to <code>testthat</code>.
</p>
<p>These translation functions are provided for your convenience.  The
<code>unitizer</code> author does not use them very much since he seldom needs to
migrate <code>testthat</code> tests.  As a result, they have not been tested as
thoroughly as the rest of <code>unitizer</code>.  Translation is designed to work
for the most common <code>testthat</code> use cases, but may not for yours.  Make
sure you <code>review</code> the resulting <code>unitizer</code>s to make sure
they contain what you expect before you start relying on them.  This is
particularly important if your <code>testthat</code> test files are not meant to
be run stand-alone with just <code>test_file</code> (see "Differences That May
Cause Problems").
</p>
<p>Note you can also <code>unitize</code> your <code>testthat</code> files <b>without</b>
translating them (see notes).
</p>


<h3>Workflow</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<p> Start a fresh R session
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Run your <code>testthat</code> tests with <code>test_dir</code> to
ensure they are still passing.  If your tests are are runnable only
via <code>test_check</code> because they directly access the namespace of your
package, see "Differences That May Cause Problems" below
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Run <code>testthat_dir_translate</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> [optional] use <code>review</code> to review the resulting
unitizer(s)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend using <code>testthat_translate_dir</code> over
<code>testthat_translate_file</code> because the former also copies and loads any
helper files that may be defined.  Since libraries used by multiple test
files are commonly loaded in these helper files, it is likely that just
translating a single file without also copying the helper files will not
work properly.
</p>


<h3>How the Conversion Works</h3>

<p>For a subset of the <code>expect_*</code> functions we extract the <code>object</code>
parameter and discard the rest of the expectation.  For example
</p>
<pre>expect_equal(my_fun(25), 1:10)</pre>
<p> becomes
</p>
<pre>my_fun(25)</pre>
<p>.  The idea is that on unitizing the expression the
result will be output to screen and can be reviewed and accepted.
Not all <code>expect_*</code> functions are substituted.  For example,
<code>expect_is</code> and <code>expect_that</code> are left unchanged because the tests
for those functions do not or might not actually test the values of
<code>object</code>.  <code>expect_gt</code> and similar are also left unchanged as that
would require more work than simply extracting the <code>object</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>It is perfectly fine to <code>unitize</code> an <code>expect_*</code> call unsubstituted.
<code>unitizer</code> captures conditions, values, etc., so if an <code>expect_*</code>
test starts failing, it will be detected.
</p>
<p><code>unitizer</code> will then evaluate and store the results of such expressions.
Since in theory we just checked our <code>testthat</code> tests were working,
presumably the re-evaluated expressions will produce the same values.  Please
note that the translation process does not actually check this is true (see
"Differences That May Cause Problems") so <code>review</code>ing the results is a
good idea.
</p>
<p><code>test_that</code> calls are converted to <code>unitizer_sect</code> calls,
and the contents thereof are processed as described above.  Calls to
<code>context</code> are commented out since there currently is no <code>unitizer</code>
equivalent.  Other <code>testthat</code> calls are left unchanged and their return
values used as part of the <code>unitizer</code> tests.
</p>
<p>Only top level calls are converted.  For example, code like
<code>for(i in 1:10) expect_equal(my_fun(i), seq(i))</code> or even
<code>(expect_equal(my_fun(10), 1:10))</code> will not be converted since
<code>expect_equal</code> is nested inside a <code>for</code> and <code>(</code> respectively.
You will need to manually edit these calls (or just let them remain as is,
which is not an issue).
</p>
<p>We identify calls to extract based purely on the function symbols (i.e. we
do not check whether <code>expect_equal</code> actually resolves to
<code>testthat::expect_equal</code> in the context of the test file).
</p>
<p>The <code>unitizer</code> files will be created in a sibling folder to the folder
containing the <code>testthat</code> files.  The names of the new files will be
based on the old files.  See params <code>target.dir</code>, <code>name.new</code>,
<code>name.pattern</code>, and <code>name.replace</code> for more details.  We encourage
you to try the default settings first as those should work well in most
cases.
</p>
<p>When using <code>testthat_translate_dir</code>, any files that match
<code>"^helper.*[rR]$"</code> are copied over to a '/_pre' subdirectory
in <code>"target.dir"</code>, and are pre-loaded by default before the tests are
<code>unitize</code>d.
</p>


<h3>
<code>unitizer</code> Differences That May Cause Problems</h3>

<p>If you run your tests during development with <code>test_dir</code> odds
are the translation will work just fine.  On the other hand, if you rely
exclusively on <code>test_check</code> you may need to use
<code>state=unitizerStateNoOpt(par.env="pkgName")</code> when you translate to
make sure your tests have access to the internal namespace functions.
See <code>unitizerState</code> for details on how to modify state tracking.
</p>
<p>If your tests were translated with the <code>state</code> parameter changed from
its default value, you will have to use the same value for that parameter in
future <code>unitize</code> or <code>unitize_dir</code> runs.
</p>


<h3>Alternate Use Cases</h3>

<p>If you wish to process <code>testthat</code> files for use with the standard R
“.Rout” / “.Rout.save process” you can set the <code>unitize</code>
and <code>use.sects</code> parameters to FALSE.
</p>
